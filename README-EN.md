## ðŸ§  Project Description

> ðŸ’­ Project will be revamped soon ðŸ’­

The "Divino Sabor" aims to provide an efficient solution for Buffet Divino Sabor to manage its operations and enhance internal processes. By modernizing and updating current processes, it centralizes them in a web environment with synchronization to a database, allowing simultaneous access from anywhere and any online device.

The website is a comprehensive web application that integrates an internal buffet management system and a public user interface. On the backend, the application offers administrative functionalities, including customer management, order control, inventory management, and buffet financial management. At the same time, the public user interface allows customers to view all available products, their prices, and other relevant information. This interface provides users with the ability to hire buffet services, providing a user-friendly and accessible experience.
